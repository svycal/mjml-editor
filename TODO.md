# TODO

- [ ] Prevent illegal drag-drop operations in the tree (see the documentation for rules)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting / proper code editing for Source view
- [ ] Allow the "default theme" to be passed in to `<MjmlEditor>`
- [ ] Maybe: overlay click targets on hover for adding sections/columns/nodes?
