/**
 * Playground CSS - Simulates a real consumer app
 *
 * This follows the same import pattern documented in the README,
 * using local paths instead of node_modules references.
 *
 * NOTE: preset.css must come BEFORE tailwindcss so that @theme tokens
 * are registered before Tailwind generates its utilities.
 *
 * The @source directive in preset.css handles scanning the library's
 * files for Tailwind classes - no additional @source needed here.
